# Cpp-Progrmming
This repository contains C++ code examples and applications, including object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, that can be used in embedded systems
Examples
This repository contains code examples and applications that demonstrate various C++ concepts, including:

Basic C++ syntax and data types
Control structures (if/else, loops, etc.)
Functions and function overloading
Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)
Templates and generics
Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms
Multithreading and concurrency
Memory management (pointers, smart pointers, etc.)
Embedded systems programming (GPIO, interrupts, timers, etc.)
The examples directory contains subdirectories for each of these categories, and each subdirectory contains one or more code examples that demonstrate the relevant concepts.
